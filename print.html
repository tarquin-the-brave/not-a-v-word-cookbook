<p>Let me start by saying that I will not be using “the V word” anywhere in this
book, and it is not a “V word cookbook” but a collection of some cooking
wisdoms that I’ve gathered over the past few year as part of being “one of
those”, having to unlearn and relearn a food culture, picking up some novel
combinations on the way.  This book will look to share some of those novel
combinations to incorporate into your cooking either as sides, starters, or
full mains with the protein of your choice substituted in.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preface"><a class="header" href="#preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>My approach to cooking has always been focussed around simplicity which permits
imprecision.  I've never been that into preparing big set pieces with thousands
of ingredients or anything that requires measuring or a precise process.
Needless to say I avoid baking at all costs (and I don't really like sweet
things.  I'll take a 2nd main over a pudding any day).</p>
<p>While this approach was likely born out of laziness rather than an appreciation
of the subtlety and simplicity of individual flavours, I'd like to think that's
where I've ended up. I now find myself stripping away ingredients from a dish
to find and appreciate the core flavours on their own.  Restaurant food
especially, is made in a way to convince you it was worth the money you paid
for it, so it has all the extra flourishes thrown in the hope that someone
doesn't think &quot;that's easy, I could do that!&quot;.  So while driven somewhat by the
ulterior motive of laziness, I have gone through a process of stripping meals
down to their bare necessities, only chucking flourishes back in when I've got
the core solid.</p>
<p>Pizza and pasta are great examples of this core simplicity.  In the past I
would always get the pizza with the most ingredients on (because &quot;clearly&quot;
that's the best). But what really makes a pizza great?  It's the tomato sauce
and the base.  Tomato sauce is so simple: olive oil, tomato, basil.  But having
a great sauce with those ingredients combined in just the right way, and in
this case the tomatoes being really good tomatoes, makes all the difference.
The base too.  A really great sourdough pizza base and I'd be happy with
nothing on it, save a drizzle of olive oil.  These days, if I go to a pub or
restaurant and I reckon they know what they're doing, I'll order the simplest
pizza they do. Take pasta arrabiata or pasta pomodoro.  They're both just pasta
with tomato sauce and chilli or basil. In a good Italian restaurant it's the
best thing on the menu.  That being said, in a mediocre Italian restaurant it's
just pasta with a tin of tomatoes slopped over it, so you've gotta try to take
the temperature of the place before ordering.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="this-book"><a class="header" href="#this-book">This Book</a></h1>
<p>I don't like cookbooks.  I tolerate them, but I always find myself scrawling
some rough notes and working from them.  One of the things they seem to never
be able to convey is what the core of the recipe is that makes it what it is.
Following a recipe in a cookbook, it's never clear to me what the stakes are
for deviating from the precise ingredients and process.  If I realise I forgot
an ingredient half way through cooking: is the meal ruined? Do I bail out and
start again?  Do I try to compensate? Or do I do nothing?  Was the ingredient
just a arbitrary flourish that made no difference to the overall meal
whatsoever, but included to make you spend hours searching a supermarket for
cilantro, only to find out it's fucking coriander... and not even important to
the dish. I then find that I stop following cookbooks' instructions, because I
grow tired of them and start guessing proportions.  This is normally fine,
until it comes to things like soy sauce, or ginger, when too much can destroy a
meal.</p>
<p>So in this book I'll aim to call out what the core of the recipe is, then add
suggestions of flourishes, while staying away from being too precise about
process or proportions, unless it really matters.  There'll be some recipes
that I haven't really dissected into &quot;a core&quot; and &quot;flourishes&quot;.  For these I'll
just say &quot;here's what you do&quot;. I'll finish each recipe with a TL;DR to serve as
a quick reference while cooking.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="some-food"><a class="header" href="#some-food">Some Food</a></h1>
<p>Enough talk!  Let's dive straight into some dishes!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sticky-umami-protein--pineapple"><a class="header" href="#sticky-umami-protein--pineapple">Sticky Umami Protein &amp; Pineapple</a></h1>
<p>Forget all that rubbish in the intro about appreciating the subtlety of
individual flavours by reducing the noise around them!  This unapologetically
bombastic big hitter, doesn't just pack a punch, it comes in like a wrecking
ball packing five.  Five huge flavours, in proportions that would overwhelm any
other dish, combine into guaranteed party pleaser.  What's more, it's so easy!</p>
<h2 id="the-core"><a class="header" href="#the-core">The Core</a></h2>
<p>First: pick your protein and chop it into cubes.  I've found this works well
with seitan, but I've also done this with microprotein &quot;This Isn't Chicken&quot;
pieces.  Anything &quot;white&quot; in the meaty sense will do.  Next prepare your
pineapple into thumbnail sized cubes (any bigger and they don't absorb the
sauce as well).  I tend to find one round slice of pineapple per person does
the job.</p>
<p>Start by putting on some rice to boil as the rest cooks rather quickly. I've
found plain brown rice to be best as the rest of the dish has enough flavour
and you find yourself wanting something plain to eat it with.</p>
<p>Fry your protein in an oil of your choosing (I tend to go with dandelion oil,
but I appreciate that's a bit niche) so it's cooked and starting to crisp.</p>
<p>Next add in the sauce and the pineapple cubes.  For the sauce we combine:
balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, English mustard (the bright yellow one) and maple
syrup.  A good dollop of mustard with a table spoon, then an equivalent amount
of both soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  The trick is to be relatively liberal
with the maple syrup as you need enough of it to reduce around the chunks and
go sticky.  As a rough guide, three times the amount of each other ingredient
is about right. You can proportionally increase all the ingredients of the
sauce to make a more intense flavour, but make sure to keep that proportion of
maple syrup high.</p>
<p>Once this is all simmering away in the pan, turn up the heat and reduce the
sauce into a sticky coating for your chunks.</p>
<p>Once that's ready serve on top of the rice.</p>
<h2 id="to-onion-or-not-to-onion---that-is-the-question"><a class="header" href="#to-onion-or-not-to-onion---that-is-the-question">To Onion Or Not To Onion - That Is The Question</a></h2>
<p>I've tried alternating onions in and out of this dish. Frying onions with the
protein has the effect of mellowing the flavours slightly.  And I mean
&quot;slightly&quot;, the dish doesn't suddenly become meditatively subtle.  I'd say try
onions on a later run of this dish, after having experienced it without them.
My current preference is without, but it's worth a try.  Shallots, if you can
be bothered to peal them, add that flavour with less of a mellowing effect.</p>
<h2 id="flourishes"><a class="header" href="#flourishes">Flourishes</a></h2>
<p>Given the strength of the core of this dish, there's a lot of scope for some
fairly consequence free experimenting with added extras to add some new
dimensions. If you're making this for the first time, I'd say don't worry about
any of these.</p>
<h3 id="rosemary"><a class="header" href="#rosemary">Rosemary</a></h3>
<p>A healthy sprinkle of rosemary while adding the sauce can help to support the
mustard by providing another avenue for the flavour to go up your nose.</p>
<h3 id="coconut-rice"><a class="header" href="#coconut-rice">Coconut Rice</a></h3>
<p>If five BIG flavours aren't enough for you, you can add one more and cook the
rice in coconut milk.</p>
<p>Be aware this is a big sweet hit being added to the meal and you may want to
turn up the balsamic vinegar and turn down the maple syrup and perhaps swap it
for a more toned down agave syrup.</p>
<p>Something nice and bitter to drink like a gin and tonic can help wash this
sweeter dish down.</p>
<h3 id="chilli-flakes"><a class="header" href="#chilli-flakes">Chilli Flakes</a></h3>
<p>This isn't supposed to be a spicy dish, and I'm not sure that adding a load of
spice would really complement the rest of the flavours.  But from time to time
I put a pinch or light sprinkle of chilli flakes in to give some variation in
the after taste.</p>
<h2 id="tldr"><a class="header" href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fry your protein,</li>
<li>Thrown in pineapple cubes &amp; the sauce:
<ul>
<li>3 parts maple syrup,</li>
<li>1 part balsamic vinegar,</li>
<li>1 part soy sauce,</li>
<li>1 part (a dollop) English mustard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduce to preference,</li>
<li>Serve on rice.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="watermelon-steaks"><a class="header" href="#watermelon-steaks">Watermelon Steaks</a></h1>
<p>Say what? This isn't a play on words, I really mean it.  Big, succulent, juicy,
dripping, rare steaks made from watermelon.</p>
<p>Once you've had one of these, you'll never look at watermelon the same again.
You'll see all the people sitting eating slices of raw watermelon and cry
&quot;barbarians!&quot;.</p>
<p>For me this filled the hole in my life that steak left. I don't crave steak
anymore.</p>
<p>These bring a world of flavour and are a fantastic party piece that'll blow
your guests' minds.  When the watermelon reduces it adopts a rare meaty
texture.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-1"><a class="header" href="#the-core-1">The Core</a></h2>
<p>Get a watermelon.  One of those miniature watermelons will do to serve 4
people. You can also use some portion of a large watermelon.  You can buy them
in halves or quarters.</p>
<p>Cut the skin off the watermelon. It's OK to leave some white bits on the
outside as this is a pretty good analogue of the rind.</p>
<p>Massage, with clean hands, some salt and soy sauce into the watermelon.  It's
OK to be fairly liberal with this as it will help the watermelon reduce.</p>
<p>Loosely wrap up the watermelon in foil and place on a baking tray in the oven.</p>
<p>Bake for an hour, then turn the watermelon over in the foil and bake for
another hour.  You'll notice the bottom half is gone wobbly and reduced down
more than the top as it's been sitting in the juice.  That's why you need to
turn it.</p>
<p>While baking prepare the marinade: A dollop of tahini; a good amount of soy
sauce; a squeeze of sriracha; a few glugs of olive oil; a splash of some form
of vinegar; some chilli flakes; and a clove of garlic, a knob of ginger, and
some spring onions, all chopped finely.</p>
<p>After baking the watermelon should have a wobbly, raw meat, texture and feel to
it.  If it is still a bit stiff, bake it some more.</p>
<p>Transfer the watermelon to a bowl or container lined in greaseproof paper.
Mark where you want to cut your steaks by making incisions roughly 1/3 the way
down as if you were slicing your steak.  With a spoon drip the marinade down
the groves, then once they're full: pour the rest of the marinade over the
watermelon and wrap up in the greaseproof paper.  Place the watermelon in the
fridge to marinade.</p>
<p>I'd say marinade it for at least 2 hours in the fridge. Longer is better.</p>
<p>When you're ready to eat the steaks: finish the incisions to cut the watermelon
into steaks.  Flash fry for just a minute or so on each side on a high high
heat. While frying you can drizzle on some of the excess marinade.</p>
<p>You can serve these with whatever you normally eat steak with. Personally I
think these work best served with a fresh crisp salad with lots of crunchy
things in like sugar snap peas, shredded carrot, and the like.</p>
<h2 id="timings"><a class="header" href="#timings">Timings</a></h2>
<p>You'll notice the total elapsed time for this dish is quite long, even though
the actually preparation time is not so much.  I tend to prepare this over a
day: baking the watermelon in the morning, mixing the marinade at lunch,

<p>If the juice that comes off the watermelon while baking chars at all, and has
little black bits floating in it, then don't worry about it and throw it away.
But if covering the watermelon has done its job and the juice is clear, save it
off in a jar.</p>
<p>It's a mix of the salt, soy sauce, and the sugars that came out of the
watermelon as it has reduced. It's great as a sweet and salty dressing for a
salad or use elsewhere in cooking.</p>

<p>Say one day we're not locked in our houses working from home all day, and you

<p>You can cut the baking time down to ~30-40 mins by slicing the raw watermelon
into steaks, opting for thinner slices, and not covering them in the oven.
Watch you don't burn them!</p>
<p>With smaller slices you can cut down the marinading time too as there will be a
greater surface area to volume ratio. As with any marinading, the longer the
better, but patience is a virtue and we're not always virtuous.  Given say ~20

<p>This one I discovered by total accident!</p>
<p>One day I was intending on making a <a href="mung-sandwich.html#eat-as-a-salad-instead">lentil salad</a>.  I
found some &quot;mung beans&quot; in the cupboard next to the lentils.  I had no idea
what they were but thought they were lentil-like so threw them in too.  I set a
pot of lentils and mung beans on the boil, then got distracted.  I was adding
little dampening rings to my mechanical keyboard as it was pretty klackerty.
The involved pulling off every key cap and pushing a silicone ring into the
inside of it. Then I got chatting to a mate on the phone.  Then about 40
minutes later, I suddenly remembered. &quot;Ah! My lentils!&quot; I exclaimed and rushed
into the kitchen to find the lentils had all swollen and started to
disintegrate, and the much beans had basically exploded.</p>
<p>It looked like the meal was a bit ruined but I noticed the exploded mung beans
had a dry fibre-y texture, almost a bit like tinned tuna... This gave me an
idea!  I added the rest of the salad ingredients, some olive oil, capers (for a
fishy flavour), and a squeeze of lemon, then blended the mixture and spread it
on toast.</p>
<p>This now stands as my go-to hearty sandwich filler.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-2"><a class="header" href="#the-core-2">The Core</a></h2>
<p>The key to this is to overcook the lentils and mung beans so they're soft and
add enough olive oil so the mixture doesn't taste too dry.</p>
<p>While the lentils are cooking, chop up some celery and cherry tomatoes (or any
tomatoes you want really), and have some capers ready (you normally have to
fish them out of a jar with a fork, so good to do ahead of time).</p>
<p>Once you've overcooked the lentils and mung beans, 30-40 minutes on the boil
should do the trick, drain and put back in the pan.</p>
<p>Throw in the celery, tomatoes, and capers.  Pour in a good couple of glugs of
olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>
<p>Mix the ingredients together and heat on a high heat for a minute or less to
give it a shock of heat to get the flavours mixing.</p>
<p>Blend the mixture.</p>
<p>Serve hot on toast or put it in the fridge for tomorrow's sandwiches. Slices
of cucumber in the sandwich perfectly complement this filling.</p>
<p>The only proportion advice I'd give, is don't over do it on the lemon.  I did
that once and it was a bit too tangy.</p>
<p><em>Mung beans are also known as adzuki/azuki/aduki beans the difference being
that adzuki beans are &quot;red mung beans&quot;, it would appear.</em></p>
<h2 id="flourishes-2"><a class="header" href="#flourishes-2">Flourishes</a></h2>
<h3 id="change-of-base"><a class="header" href="#change-of-base">Change of Base</a></h3>
<p>While the base of this is mung bean and lentils, you can try basing this on
more or other legumes such as chickpeas, soybeans, etc.</p>
<p>When I tried chickpeas, the texture of the mixture went a bit potato-y, and I
didn't like it as much.</p>
<h3 id="spices"><a class="header" href="#spices">Spices</a></h3>
<p>I've not experimented too much with putting much spices in this.  When I've had
fresh parsley to hand, that's gone in.</p>
<p>I'd guess the green herby herbs would do well in this.  I'm unsure what the
effect of adding chilli to it would be.  Try it.</p>
<h2 id="eat-as-a-salad-instead"><a class="header" href="#eat-as-a-salad-instead">Eat as a Salad Instead</a></h2>
<p>You can, of course, not overcook the lentils and mung beans, use less olive

<p>Ever find pasta a bit too heavy. I do.  But also really love pasta.  I do.
Here's a way you can combine it with something lighter and embark on an odyssey
flavour.</p>
<p>What I'm talking about when I say &quot;odyssey of flavour&quot; is unlike when you have
flavours meld, by slow cooking or giving a flash of heat, every mouthful is a
different flavour.  It's got sweet, sour, salty, herby, all hitting you one by
one.</p>
<p>If you're bored of pasta, this will reignite it.</p>
<h2 id="heres-what-to-do"><a class="header" href="#heres-what-to-do">Here's What To Do</a></h2>
<p>Put the oven on. Get a head of cauliflower and chop up into florets.</p>
<p>Make a dressing from: the juice of a lemon, some olive oil, syrup (maple or
agave), a knob of ginger (chopped or grated), a couple of garlic cloves, a
tablespoon of cumin, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and few cracks of salt.  Give that
a good mix.</p>
<p>Toss the cauliflower florets with small amount of the dressing (2-3
tablespoons) to coat them, spread them out on a baking tray, and pop them in
the oven.  It should take 20 or so minutes for the florets to roast golden, but
keep an eye on them as you don't want to over do it.</p>
<p>Stick some pasta on the boil.  As you've got the cauliflower joining the fray,
put on half as much pasta as you would for a &quot;pasta and sauce&quot; dish.</p>
<p>Chop up some olives and dried apricots. A couple of handfuls of each should do
the trick.  I normally just keep chopping 'til I get bored and then call it.</p>
<p>Once the pasta &amp; cauliflower is ready drain the pasta and save 100ml or so of
the pasta water.  Put the pasta, cauliflower, olives, and apricots in a cold
pot, serving dish, or mixing bowl.  Mix the pasta water you saved off with the
dressing then pour over the rest of the ingredients in the pot.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-important-thing"><a class="header" href="#the-most-important-thing">The Most Important Thing</a></h2>
<p>The key thing in this dis is to not let the flavours meld. This is why it's a
good idea to mix it all together in a cold container and not in the still warm
pan the pasta was cooked in.</p>
<p>I cooked this recipe once, mixing all the ingredients in the pan, and even gave
it a quick flash on a high heat to help the flavours mix.  It wasn't nice.
Because the main ingredients, the cauliflower florets, the pasta pieces, the
dried apricots, the olives, are all whole and solid things, you'll only have
one or two of them on each forkful. It's a really enjoyable dish when each
forkful takes you to a different place.</p>

<p>This has been one of my longest standing meals I've made myself, and always
been a great one for impressing guests, and making it look like it took way
more effort than it did. The difference this brings to most stir-frys this is
more about what's not in it.  It doesn't include some special sauce out of a
packet or painstakingly constructed from scratch, you don't need it.  It
doesn't include noodles, you don't need them.  Noodles can turn what should be
a light and crisp affair into some tummy swelling stodge.</p>
<p>Being one of my oldest recipes it's very much in keeping with my <a href="./introduction.html#my-cooking-philosophy">core cooking
philosophy</a> of always aiming to strip
meals down to the their core bits, enjoying the simplicity of that, then
throwing things back in when you get bored.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-4"><a class="header" href="#the-core-4">The Core</a></h2>
<p>Put simply this is some stir fried veg served on some salad leaves, with

great variety and mean you won't have too much of anything going to waste.
It's worth getting the posh ones like Tesco finest or Sainsbury's taste the
difference as they've got all sorts of fancy veggies in,</p>
<p>Using that pre assembled pack as a base, throw in some pak choi, and any other
veggies that aren't already in the mix that you want.</p>
<p>Really quickly flash fry so the veggies are still al dente.</p>
<p>Put into bowls lined with raw lettuce and spinach.</p>
<p>Add slices of ready-to-eat beetroot and sprinkle over seeds (any seeds, you can

<p>The easiest, quickest crowd pleaser around.  Seven minutes to perfection.
Starter, side, nibbles, or quick lunchtime snack.  Minimal effort, let the
ingredients do the talking and you can take all the credit.</p>
<p>For me this dish is a great opportunity to exercise simplicity, opting for
fewer ingredients to let each pitta be focussed on just a couple of flavours.
You can also squeeze on every topping under the sun and do all the flourishes
in one go.  Up to you.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-5"><a class="header" href="#the-core-5">The Core</a></h2>
<p>Get some pitta breads, smear on some tomato puree, add any ingredients you
want, drizzle over some olive oil, bake in the oven for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>For any toppings you do put on: it's best to make sure they're thin slices, so
they cook a bit in the short time.</p>
<p>The only other note I'd make is that the tomato puree will make or break this
dish.  Splash out the extra 50p and get the posh one.</p>
<h2 id="toppings"><a class="header" href="#toppings">Toppings</a></h2>
<p>There's some obvious toppings that you'd expect: olives, mushrooms, artichoke
hearts, onion.</p>
<p>There's also some you might not expect...</p>
<p>Potato! Yes potato on pizza is a Swedish thing apparently, and with these pitta
pizzas, thin slices of new potatoes works incredibly.</p>
<p>Caramelized onion is another winner.  It does mean you have to make some
caramelized onions though, which elevates the faff to results ratio somewhat
as caramelizing onions takes foreeeeeeeeeeeever...</p>
<p>So really you can put whatever toppings on you like, it's your pitta.  The only
thing I'd say is &quot;less is more&quot; when it comes to toppings.  What I've done in
the past is when preparing a platter of 4 or so pitta pizzas and chopping them
up to share or have as nibbles, I've put one or two toppings on each. That cuts
out a lot of the noise and lets you appreciate the beautiful simplicity of the
individual flavours.</p>
<h2 id="flourishes-5"><a class="header" href="#flourishes-5">Flourishes</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;flourishes&quot; of this dish come in what you do with the sauce.</p>
<p>I've said to smear tomato puree on the pitta base.  Try mixing in some chilli
puree, garlic puree, BBQ sauce, or pesto (but not all at once).  Little
separate dollops of pesto also works well.</p>
<p>You can also try sprinkling herbs across before adding the toppings. &quot;generic
Italian herb mix&quot; is a good start, but I'd recommend finding one herb that you
really want the flavour of in the pizza and sticking to that.</p>

<p><em>Or &quot;eggplant&quot; if you're that way inclined.</em></p>
<p>A great surprise addition to a BBQ. We suffer somewhat from having a set idea
what BBQ food is, when really you can do anything.  You can pre-prepare this
one, wrap it in foil, and sneak it onto the BBQ while no-one's watching.  Once
cooked, you can open up the tin foil give everyone a fork and gather round.
This will have more flavour than most of what's on the rest of the BBQ
combined.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-6"><a class="header" href="#the-core-6">The Core</a></h2>
<p>Aubergine &amp; miso paste.</p>
<p>Chop you aubergines in half long ways. Score the flesh on the inside of the
aubergine with the knife to draw a grid pattern.  I like to make grid squares
about 2cm x 2cm and cut right down to the inside of the skin so you can scoop
out cubes one by one when eating. You need a bit of a stead hand to not cut
through the skin too.</p>
<p>Using a combination of a spoon and clean fingers: smear miso paste over the
aubergine, getting as much of it as you can down the cracks in your grid
pattern.</p>
<p>Wrap up each aubergine half in foil and cook on the BBQ for 20-30 mins. It's
hard to say exactly as BBQs vary from those mini disposable ones to gas giants.
You want to cook them till the aubergine flesh has lost its firmness, and then
a bit longer to get the miso flavour to fully mix in.</p>
<h2 id="flourishes-6"><a class="header" href="#flourishes-6">Flourishes</a></h2>
<h3 id="maple-syrup"><a class="header" href="#maple-syrup">Maple Syrup</a></h3>
<p>Once you've smeared on the miso paste, spread some maple syrup over the top.
This will add another flavour dimension to the aubergine and make the flesh go
all sticky.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-squares-or-baby-aubergines"><a class="header" href="#smaller-squares-or-baby-aubergines">Smaller Squares or Baby Aubergines</a></h3>
<p>If you're looking to get more of a sauce to go into more of a food thing, you
will want to increase the surface area to volume ratio.  You do that by making
things smaller.  It's why you can drop a squirrel out of a plane.</p>
<p>With this dish, with the recommended 2cm x 2cm squares, you get a bit of a
gradient where the centre of the cubes haven't got as much of the miso taste in
them.  If you want the miso to permeate through more of the aubergine you can
cut smaller squares, or use baby aubergines to get the size reduction in a 3rd
dimension.</p>

<p>A great cupboard clearer.</p>
<p>We've all done it.  While aimlessly wondering around the super market passed
the tinned bean isle, seen some exotic sounding bean name that you've never
heard of and thought, yeah go on.  This tin of beans then sits at the back of
your kitchen cupboard for years taking up space.  Eventually, having never seen
a recipe where you can use them, you give up and crack the tin, drain them, and
plop them on a salad, or serve with you main meal, only to find they're pretty
bland on their own.</p>
<p>We know the usual suspect for this: fava beans, black eye beans, boroletti
beans, butter beans, aduki beans, haricot beans, &quot;mixed&quot; beans, flageolet beans
(no idea how to pronounce that one), pinto beans, lupin beans, the list goes
on. I've just been perusing an organic shop website to find those names, I'd
not be able to name any of them off the top of my head.  It's a long list.
It's not like &quot;person, woman, man, camera, TV&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="heres-what-to-do-2"><a class="header" href="#heres-what-to-do-2">Here's What To Do</a></h2>
<p>Get a pie dish.</p>
<p>Put on the boil: enough potato, sweet potato, and any other root vegetables
that you have lying around (carrots make a pretty tasty addition), to provide
an inch thick mashed top in your dish.  If in doubt, cook more, you can always
use the excess elsewhere.  I always leave the skins on.  There's so much
texture and flavour that gets thrown away when you peel veg.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stick the oven on and prepare the pie dish. This is where you take
all those tins of odd beans, drain them, rinse them, and chuck them in the pie
dish.</p>
<p>Then throw in a tin of tomatoes, a couple of chopped garlic cloves, and some
mix of other such &quot;back of the cupboard&quot; sauces you've got lying around: Lea &amp;
Perrins, a squeeze of HP, maybe a dollop of mustard, go nuts.  Throw in some
herbs to preference.  A standard blend like &quot;Herb de Provence&quot;, or &quot;Italian
Herb Mix&quot;, would be a good fit for this dish.  I can never get that excited
about black pepper, it seems to either go unnoticed, or be too much and destroy
a dish. But if you like adding pepper, you can crack some of that in too.</p>
<p>Once Potato and Co. have boiled enough to be mashable: take them out and mash
them.  I like my mash quite rough and chunky, and for this dish it provides
quite a nice texture to the pie top.  I quite firmly believe that it is
essential for all mash to have copious amount of mustard mixed into it. Do with

<p>Make sure the pie contents is nicely mixed together then top the pie with about
a centimetre (or two) of your mash.  I think it's good to have a thin top.  I
like pies to be mostly filling. You only need enough to cover the filling. You
can take the opportunity to decorate you pie by taking a fork and drawing a
pretty pattern, writing a special message, or just drawing a cock.</p>
<p>Slowly bake the pie on a lower heat for ~45 minutes or so. Everything is
already cooked, you're just slow cooking it to let the flavours meld.</p>

<p>Kale is pretty boring, you've got to give it some flavour.  What better to
flavour it with than a creamy peanut sauce.</p>

<p>Prepare a peanut sauce in a pyrex jar by mixing some dollops of peanut butter
with some cream (soy, oat, or coconut) and enough hot water for it to mix
together smoothly.</p>
<p>Begin to stir fry some thin slices of parsnip (or any other root vegetable like
potato or sweet potato) and celery in wok.</p>
<p>Once they're fried a little pile the kale over the top and pour a little bit of
water over everything so the kale steams over the other vegetables. You can
also drizzle over some soy sauce.</p>
<p>Once the kale has shrunk up and taken up a dark green colour throughout, pour
over the peanut sauce and stir everything together and reduce until the sauce
is sufficiently thick.</p>

<p>We've all done it: been browsing through the supermarket and spotted some food
with a strange name and remembered hearing about it being a great food for some
health benefit, but you can't remember what, so bought a tin or pack, got home
and had no idea what to do with it, so let it sit at the back of the cupboard
for the rest of time. One day you spot it, have a go including it in a meal,
and it's disgusting. When you look up the name, it turns out the fancy name is
an alternative name for something more recognisable. &quot;Edamame&quot; springs to mind.
Turns out they're just soy beans.  So: cattle feed.  Excellent.  Still
delicious but a bit less glamorous with that realisation.</p>
<p>This was my experience with a pack of &quot;split fava beans&quot;.  When I first
attempted to cook them they were bland and horrible, it was like trying to eat
wet sand.  Looking them up, it turns out they're also known as &quot;broad beans&quot;.</p>
<p>I've recently be having a bit of a kitchen clear out and trying to &quot;eat the
cupboards&quot;.  This pack of split fava beans had its turn.  With the previous
attempt of cooking them a not too distant memory, I had a real go at making
these fava beans taste nice.  I was pretty happy with what came out, and it fit
this book's mantra of &quot;novel combinations&quot;, so here it is.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-8"><a class="header" href="#the-core-8">The Core</a></h2>
<p>Combine the fava beans with pearl barley and simmer in a pan of water with some
stock mixed in. Between the two of them they absorb a fair amount of water so
you'll likely need to add more as it cooks. 30-40 minutes should do it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, make an arrabiata sauce by frying some onions and garlic until the
onions are soft, adding in some tinned tomatoes, herbs of your choice, and some
chilli (fresh, flakes, or chilli sauce - take your pick).</p>
<p>Drain the barley and fava mix and serve the sauce over the top of them.</p>
<h2 id="flourishes-8"><a class="header" href="#flourishes-8">Flourishes</a></h2>
<p>To the sauce you can add a protein of your choice.  I put in some dried soy
pieces myself.  They come out as these little balls that are much tougher than
tofu, so have a decent bite to them.  They're also ridiculously cheap.</p>
<p>With such a simple sauce, the rest comes down to what herbs you pick to add in.
You can't go wrong with an &quot;Italian Herb Mix&quot;, or &quot;Herb de Provence&quot;, but I
prefer to pick just one or two herbs and have them stand out.  You can always
look at the ingredients of a herb mix and pick one to try on its own.</p>

<p>You may have had something like this in a restaurant or pub as a starter or
side.  In fact the number of &quot;Bang&quot;s above is not just a reflection of how
delicious this is but also to not name this exactly as it is named in a popular
Japanese restaurant.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this dish is a shining example of the sort of cooking I like
best: &quot;make boring veg taste good&quot;, while doing something incredibly simple. In
fact: the core concept to this dish is so simple, it's actually a bit hard to
express it in the &quot;Core, then Flourishes&quot; format of this book.  &quot;The Core&quot; will
go a bit beyond the truly minimal core of this recipe. But here goes...</p>
<h1 id="the-core-9"><a class="header" href="#the-core-9">The Core</a></h1>
<p>Essentially what we're doing here is cooking up some cauliflower with some
chillies and spices in sesame oil. We can also include one or two other
&quot;complimentary&quot; veggies (e.g: celery, peppers, what ever you have lying around
in the fridge).</p>
<p>Chop the cauliflower into florets of a size that you'd be comfortable forking
into your mouth.  The size of your mouth might be a factor here.  Chop any
complimentary veggies into much smaller pieces than your cauliflower florets.
You're going to be going for the florets with your fork and you want some of
the other bits of veg to come with it.</p>
<p>Throws these into a mixing bowl, pour in some sesame oil, sprinkle in some
sesame seeds, and shake in some Chinese five spice.</p>
<p>You can either chop up some fresh chillies and throw them in or shake over some
chilli seeds (or even just add in chilli sauce at the end if you don't have
either of those).  The more chilli the better I'd say.  It's meant to be a
spicy dish.  But of course, add chilli to taste.</p>
<p>Get your hands in and toss that mixture all around so the oil, spices, and
chilli are evenly distributed.</p>
<p>Throw all this into a pan or wok on a high heat and cook 'til the cauliflower
is browning slightly.</p>
<p>It's now ready to eat.  You can serve up as it is with a splash of soy sauce or
add a sauce into the pan (<a href="bang-cauliflower.html#the-sauce">see below</a>).</p>
<h1 id="flourishes-9"><a class="header" href="#flourishes-9">Flourishes</a></h1>
<h2 id="how-i-did-it-last-time"><a class="header" href="#how-i-did-it-last-time">How I Did It Last Time</a></h2>
<p>The last time I did this I went with mushrooms and celery as the &quot;complimentary
veg&quot;, used fresh chillies for spice, and added in cherry tomatoes and peanut
butter at the end to make a sauce.</p>
<p>I added finely chopped celery to the mixing bowl with the cauliflower florets
to toss with the celery with the sesame oil, sesame seeds, freshly chopped
chillies, and Chinese five spice. I tossed the mushrooms in olive oil in a
separate bowl before adding all of this to the pan for frying.</p>
<p>Once the cauliflower was cooked I added some chopped cherry tomatoes, a couple
of spoonfuls of peanut butter, a splash of soy sauce, and poured over a decent
amount of water from the kettle.</p>
<p>I mixed it all together and put a lid on the pan to let it all stew for a
little bit.  I then took the lid off the pan and let the excess water boil off
'til the sauce had reduced to the thickness I wanted.</p>
<p>I served it on rice.</p>
<h2 id="the-sauce"><a class="header" href="#the-sauce">The Sauce</a></h2>
<p>The simplest possible version of a sauce for this could be to add in some soy
sauce and water to the pan and let to water boil off.  Perhaps putting in a bit
of cornflour to thicken it up a bit.</p>
<p>For a more savoury flavour you could put in some dollops of peanut butter or
tahini, as I did above.</p>
<p>You could also go for more of a sticky glaze.  For this you need something
sugary like: sugar, honey, maple or agave syrup.  Add this in with a reasonable
amount of water so everything gets spread around evenly.  Boil off the water
until a sugary coating covers all the bits of veg.</p>
<h2 id="other-possibilities"><a class="header" href="#other-possibilities">Other Possibilities</a></h2>
<p>The rest of the possibility space around this dish is in what you include in
the &quot;complimentary veg&quot;.  Last time I made this I held an onion in my hand for
a good few seconds before deciding against it.  Partly because the celery was
already performing the supporting role, but also because I didn't want yet
anther evening's cooking to start with chopping an onion.</p>
<p>I suppose you can take a &quot;whatever you've got in the fridge&quot; approach to this.
That's what I did with the cherry tomatoes and it was a lovely addition
flavour.</p>

<p>Not full recipes.  Maybe one day they may grow into that.  But some whole
hearted recommendations that can make good on food.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="coconut-greens"><a class="header" href="#coconut-greens">Coconut Greens</a></h1>
<p>As kids we're told to eat our greens. They get boiled to death and slopped on
your plate.  It's somewhere between a chore and torture.  Later in life some
fitness freak will tell you you have to steam all your greens.  For the right
greens in the right dish, this can add a crisp freshness to offset something
else that's quite intense in terms of saltiness, oiliness, or stodgy. But
steaming every vegetable can also leave you with tasteless and soulless food.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want your greens to just taste EPIC on their own accord.  Enter
coconut.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-10"><a class="header" href="#the-core-10">The Core</a></h2>
<p>The core of this is to toss your greens in coconut oil and desiccated coconut
(coconut dust), then cook as you like.</p>
<p>Placing on a oven tray lined with tin foil and putting under the grill is how
I'd cooked them.  You can also bake or fry them.  However you cook them, I'd
advise not over doing it and keeping the greens with a bit of bite to them.</p>
<h2 id="which-greens"><a class="header" href="#which-greens">Which Greens?</a></h2>
<p>I'd say any greens that hold their shape when cooked and have a nice al dente
bite.  So not leafy greens, or legumes.  Some great examples of greens I've
cooked like this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tenderstem Broccoli (top recommendation),</li>
<li>Okra, and</li>
<li>Asparagus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flourishes-10"><a class="header" href="#flourishes-10">Flourishes?</a></h2>
<p>I could go into flourishes.  But really you should add whatever you like.  Also
you'd only be a few flourishes and a bit of chilli away from a simple Thai
curry.</p>
<h2 id="tldr-13"><a class="header" href="#tldr-13">TL;DR</a></h2>

<li>Toss your greens in coconut oil and coconut dust,</li>
<li>Grill - keep al dente.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="quinoa-in-granola"><a class="header" href="#quinoa-in-granola">Quinoa In Granola</a></h1>
<p>Wat? I agree. It sounds mental. But when the granola is toasting in the oven
the quinoa pops and gives the granola a real light texture. Normally I find
granola out of a packet a bit heavy going, I'm not a great morning eater, and
too sugary!</p>
<p>Granola out of a packet never has that same toasted flavour, and I've not yet
seen one where they've put quinoa in it!</p>
<h2 id="the-core-11"><a class="header" href="#the-core-11">The Core</a></h2>
<p>The core of this granola is: oats, quinoa, Brazil nuts, and some syrup to bind
it all together (maple syrup is good).</p>
<p>The Brazil nuts are a must! When toasted they adopt this incredible flavour,
and have a really great bite!</p>
<p>Mix the ingredients in a bowl, lay out on a baking tray, and roast in the oven
for about 10 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="flourishes-11"><a class="header" href="#flourishes-11">Flourishes</a></h2>
<p>While making a granola with just the core ingredients above will be delicious,
I'd take the opportunity to throw in every nut, and seed, you've got in your
cupboard.  Here's a few I've mixed in in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cashew nuts,</li>
<li>Pistachio nuts,</li>
<li>Pine nuts,</li>
<li>Sunflower seeds,</li>
<li>Chia seeds - these also pop like the quinoa,</li>
<li>Pumpkin seeds,</li>
<li>Agave syrup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any nut you add, add them raw.</p>
<p>After toasting you can throw in some desiccated coconut (coconut dust).  It's
nice! But I've stopped adding this as it does dominate the flavour a bit, and
there's enough coconut in my life as it stands.</p>
<p>Adding dried fruit? I'm not personally a fan of this.  I don't like the texture
going from crunchy to squidgy and back to crunchy as I'm eating.  I prefer to
serve the granola with fresh fruit or a smoothie. But if that's you're thing,
go for it!</p>
<h2 id="tldr-14"><a class="header" href="#tldr-14">TL;DR</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Mix oats, quinoa, and Brazil nuts in a bowl,</li>
<li>Mix in whatever the hell else you want,</li>
<li>Throw in some maple syrup - the more you put in the more clumpy the granola
will be,</li>
<li>Toast in the oven for 10 mins,</li>
<li>Throw in any extras and store.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="raw-food-dinners"><a class="header" href="#raw-food-dinners">Raw Food Dinners</a></h1>
<p>What's that?  Well, it's exactly what it says on the tin: chop up a bunch of
raw vegetables in a load of funky ways, place them all in the middle of the
table, gather round and tuck in!</p>
<h2 id="but-why"><a class="header" href="#but-why">But Why?</a></h2>
<p>It's a good question.  Why does a cookbook have a page dedicated to not cooking
anything? Why bother cooking when we can just eat raw food? I wonder about that
sometimes. A couple of years ago I had a phase of doing a raw food dinner once
in every few weeks.</p>
<p>The main reason for me was to strip food back to it's raw flavours and textures
and just appreciate them.</p>
<p>It's a very refreshing meal, partly due to it being a change from the usual,
and simply due to the high water content of raw vegetables.</p>
<p>Most of the things you hear in the way of &quot;nutritional science&quot; tend to come
from sources that... aren't science. So take this with a pinch of salt, but
apparently, certain nutrients get denatured when we cook food and we miss out
on their benefits.  I suppose that conversely there are other nutrients that
only cooking can &quot;unlock&quot;, such as turning starch into carbohydrates and
sugars.  Cooking is on aggregate an endothermic reaction, so if you were going
to cook or not cook all of your food, I'd guess the latter would have the
higher nutritional value on aggregate. But that's not to say there isn't some
nutrients that raw veg presents a better source for.  My general take on
nutrition is &quot;don't worry about it&quot;.  If you get ill and a doctor tells you to
worry about a specific one, worry about that specific one, otherwise don't
worry about it.  With one exception: I keep half an eye on my B12, given I only
eat plants.</p>
<p><em>I've been careful to use the word &quot;nutrient&quot; as a general term for &quot;something
your body might need at some point&quot;, rather than go down the path of talking
about &quot;vitamins and minerals&quot;, whatever they are.</em></p>
<p>We could go on making vacuous platitudes about nutrition, or we could recognise
there's some far more valid reasons to crack on with a raw food dinner.  Such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean out your fridge,</li>
<li>Realising you were a bit trigger happy when ordering the now apparently
gargantuan veg delivery that's just been dropped off and won't fit in your
fridge or cupboards, or even</li>
<li>Wanting to sympathise with gorillas.  To truly understand our simian cousins
we must first graze as they do!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-core-12"><a class="header" href="#the-core-12">The Core</a></h2>
<p>For me, the core of this is to get a good variety of veg and try chopping up
each in different ways to see how that can affect the texture.</p>
<h2 id="suggestions"><a class="header" href="#suggestions">Suggestions</a></h2>
<p>A side from all the familiar faces from salads we know: lettuce, tomato, sugar
snap peas, radishes, avocado, cucumber, celery, there are some others that
might be more of a novelty to eat raw.</p>
<h3 id="spiralize-the-phallic-veg"><a class="header" href="#spiralize-the-phallic-veg">Spiralize The Phallic Veg</a></h3>
<p>You can get a hand held veg spiralized off the internet for around £10, and
they're effectively a pencil sharpener for vegetables.</p>
<p>The effect of long spaghetti-fied strips of vegetable is the surface area to
volume ratio radically increases.  This dramatically changes the relationship
between texture and flavour and allows other flavours to meld in.</p>
<p>Carrot is the veg I've found most transformed by being spiralized/shredded.
Chunks of raw carrot: dull, too much hard word.  Shredded carrot: amazing!</p>
<h3 id="courgette"><a class="header" href="#courgette">Courgette</a></h3>
<p>While courgettes are the champion veg for spiralizing I also really like the
texture of very thin circular slices.</p>
<h3 id="cabbage"><a class="header" href="#cabbage">Cabbage</a></h3>
<p>Red cabbage has a bit more flavour.  I generally really hate limp floppy cooked
cabbage, especially when the flavour has been steamed or boiled out of it.  Raw
cabbage chopped into thin slices is a totally different thing.  It's crisp and
sharp and delicious.</p>
<h3 id="mushrooms"><a class="header" href="#mushrooms">Mushrooms</a></h3>
<p>I didn't even know you could eat mushrooms raw 'til a couple of years ago. But
it turns out you can and they've got a completely different texture.</p>
<h3 id="potato"><a class="header" href="#potato">Potato</a></h3>
<p>Apparently this isn't very good for you because we can't digest it properly,
but I absolutely love the taste of raw potatoes.  So maybe just chop up one
baby potato to taste a few slices.</p>
<h2 id="cheat-a-bit---flavour-it-up"><a class="header" href="#cheat-a-bit---flavour-it-up">Cheat A Bit - Flavour It Up</a></h2>
<p>I'll admit, only raw veg for dinner is hard core. When I do this I tend to wash
it down with a pot of hummus, some olive oil, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and
perhaps some nut butter.</p>
<p>And of course, wine.</p>

<li>Chop up raw veg,</li>

<p>This was going to be a recipe in itself, but I haven't reliably got it to come
out good yet.  I don't really know what &quot;the core&quot; of it is. The last two times
I made it, it came out horrible.  It was vaguely a recipe where you fry up
chunks of apple, then throw in peanuts, raisins, curry powder and water then
let simmer for a bit and serve on coconut rice.  The last time I made it, it
came out <em>way</em> to sweet.  It tasted like a pudding.  And I don't like puddings
that much. I'd normally rather have second main.  I think the trick is going to
be picking an apple that's especially tart and not over cooking it.  I'll give
it another go at some point.</p>
<p>Although, the times that dish did work: the result was incredible.  And so
novel.  A fruit curry!  Who'd have thought!?</p>
<p>I'd say my takeaway from the times it has worked has been:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't be afraid to toss whatever fruit you've got that needs
eating in whatever you're cooking, curries especially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I suppose the takeaway from when it has gone wrong is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't make it the centre of the dish and expect it to not come
out sweet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We tend to think of fruit as being reserved for sweet dishes, but actually you
see them cropping up all over the place (the <a href="./mushroom-orange.html">Mushroom &amp; Orange
Tartare</a> in this book, for example) in savoury dishes

or when they turn up somewhere unexpected.</p>
<h2 id="tamarind"><a class="header" href="#tamarind">Tamarind</a></h2>
<p>I'd never heard of tamarind until I was working through a cookbook in order of
country of origin and found it featured heavily in Afghan dishes.  It was a big
book.  Didn't get beyond &quot;B&quot; to be honest. Turns out when a country features
heavily in the book you get a week of eating the same thing.  One of the
countries beginning with &quot;A&quot; was heavy on the stews and casseroles.  I don't
like stew.</p>
<p>But anyway tamarind... It's got a wonderfully mellow sweet and savoury flavour.
On on the Afghan dishes was simply potatoes cooked in tamarind sauce made by
frying some onions then adding stock, spices, &amp; tamarind paste.</p>
<p>Tamarind paste is a great addition to curries or sauces that can add an
unexpected twist.</p>
<p>Idea: tamarind paste added to pie filling?</p>
<p>Where to find it: after searching high and low in every organic shop in
Islington I eventually resorted to ordering this online.  A week later I found
it in Sainsbury's.</p>
<h2 id="celery---the-flavour-stabilizer"><a class="header" href="#celery---the-flavour-stabilizer">Celery - The Flavour Stabilizer</a></h2>
<p>You'll notice a common ingredient of vegetable soups is almost always celery.
I'd always considered celery as this &quot;nothing ingredient&quot; that didn't add
anything.</p>
<p>But now I've found I'm adding celery to more and more.  It doesn't have much of
a distinct flavour on it's own but added to soup, stew, or even stir fry, it
adds a freshness and helps meld the other flavours into each other, taking away
the sharp edges. I've now always got some celery knocking around in my fridge.
A staple.</p>
<h2 id="silken-tofu"><a class="header" href="#silken-tofu">Silken Tofu</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Tofu is horrible&quot;.  I'm with you on that for plain old regular tofu you get.
Regular tofu is like boiled chicken.  It needs the flavour adding to it.
Which, to be fair, if you consider the effort that goes into seasoning meat, if
the same level of devotion went into seasoning tofu it would probably be
alright. There are some really great tofus you can get where the seasoning has
already been done.  There's this extra firm smoked tofu I get that's perfect in
a breakfast bap.  I fry slices of it up with some mushrooms them pop them in a
toasted pitta with sriracha.</p>
<p>Anyway, silken tofu.  It's a completely different beast than regular tofu.  It
disintegrates in your fingers and has a real creamy and smooth texture.  It's
great for thickening up sauces and curries, and adds a great texture.  I once
made these deep fried dumplings filled with silken tofu, leek and spices.  They
were great, but trying to deep fry something in a pan on your hob can get
pretty hairy. I heated the oil up too hot and when I put the first dumpling it
it was like dropping potassium in water!</p>
<h2 id="smoked-garlic"><a class="header" href="#smoked-garlic">Smoked Garlic</a></h2>
<p>I don't know how I've gone through life, not discovering this was a thing until
quite recently.  It's like the two best flavours rolled into one.  Highly
recommend.</p>
<p>The smoking process leaves them a bit squidgy compared with a regular garlic
clove, so don't think it's gone off or anything.</p>
<h2 id="truffle-oil"><a class="header" href="#truffle-oil">Truffle Oil</a></h2>
<p>If you see truffle oil crisps in a shop: buy them, eat them. They are possibly
the tastiest thing on the planet.</p>
<p>Truffle oil is fantastic on roast potatoes, and anywhere else you want to
infuse the flavour with the nectar of the gods.</p>
<p>It is a very strong flavour mind.  Anything it is added to is then forever know
by the prefix &quot;truffle oil&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="lemongrass"><a class="header" href="#lemongrass">Lemongrass</a></h2>
<p>I don't really know what the flavour of lemongrass is.  But I do know when I
add it to things, it makes them taste great.  I wish I could be more precise
about what it's good for, but I don't really know.  Try putting it on
everything I guess.</p>
<h2 id="carrot-tops"><a class="header" href="#carrot-tops">Carrot Tops</a></h2>
<p>These get cut off the carrots that get sold to you in the supermarkets.  But
IRL, carrots come with these big green things popping out the top of them...
And they're edible and they're delicious.</p>
<p>I've come across them recently by getting carrots via a local growers' veg
delivery service.  They're great in salads, as a garnish, or anywhere else that
you might put fresh herbs.</p>
<p>You can use them as a base for homemade pesto, blending them up with other
fresh herbs, some nuts, salt, and lots of olive oil.</p>
<h2 id="frozen-ginger"><a class="header" href="#frozen-ginger">Frozen Ginger</a></h2>
<p>I never get through a whole ginger root before it starts to go mouldy. Once the
root has stopped being nice and fresh: cut it into cubes and freeze it.</p>
<h2 id="soy-sauce-on-pizza"><a class="header" href="#soy-sauce-on-pizza">Soy Sauce on Pizza</a></h2>
<p>Wat? I shit you not.  This takes pizza into the next dimension.  Don't believe
me?  Try it on a slice.</p>
<h2 id="tabasco-on-pastry"><a class="header" href="#tabasco-on-pastry">Tabasco on Pastry</a></h2>
<p>Tabasco rears its head in all sorts of weird places: in drinks, on oysters, and
here's another one: on savoury pastry.</p>
<p>Once you've dripped Tabasco down the back of a sausage roll you'll never look
back.</p>
<h2 id="oyster-mushrooms"><a class="header" href="#oyster-mushrooms">Oyster Mushrooms</a></h2>
<p>There's as many mushrooms in the world as there are people... or something like
that.  Anyway, of all the mushrooms you can find, oyster mushrooms are among
the best.  They've got a real tough texture and a strong flavour.</p>
<p>In general I'd say wherever you might use regular old closed cup button
mushrooms, try using oyster mushrooms instead.</p>
<p>A great way to eat them is to batter them with panko breadcrumbs and cook them
in the oven, then have a hoisin sauce or soy sauce to dip them in.</p>
<p>More generally, you can get packs of &quot;wild mushrooms&quot; with all sorts of exotic
mushrooms in.  Substituting regular old mushrooms for these fancy once can
bring a whole new world of flavour to your dishes.</p>
<h2 id="freekeh"><a class="header" href="#freekeh">Freekeh</a></h2>
<p>So quinoa was a revolution.  Back in the days when it was pronounced
&quot;quinn-oh-ah&quot; by the middle class mums idling down Waitrose isles.  Later we
find out a surge in demand in the developed world has caused a scarcity for
those who depended on it as a staple food.</p>
<p>Freekeh is in that revolutionary stage.  We probably all pronounce it wrong,
and some point later we'll hear about the problems our sudden increase in
demand for a food that's been an eastern Mediterranean staple for millennia.
But for now we can go to a fancy store and pay a ridiculous price for a tiny
amount of it and revel in the fact we're eating the grain that the most in
vogue.</p>
<p>It is bloody delicious though.  Well worth a try.  Prepare it with a few
tomatoes, celery, peppers, feta cheese (or alternative), with a healthy amount
of olive oil poured over and you've got yourself a pretty sound meal.</p>
<h2 id="pearl-barley"><a class="header" href="#pearl-barley">Pearl Barley</a></h2>
<p>If you don't care about following the latest trends.  If you want a hearty
grain that's packed full of flavour. Look no further than pearl barley.</p>
<p>If you're looking to cut down on pasta, as it can be quite bloating, replace
the pasta in any pasta dish with pearl barley.  Pearl barley bolognese!</p>
<p>It's also a great bed to serve your protein on.  And a fantastic base for a
salad.</p>
<p>It can really pack a punch when added to winter stews and casseroles.</p>
<p>I've been know to eat it on its own.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="your-recipes"><a class="header" href="#your-recipes">Your Recipes</a></h1>
<p>I'm interested to read about any plant-based recipes you have!</p>
<p>If you want to recreate a book like this, I've written <a href="./do-this-yourself.html">a

<p>I'm happy to link to anything you publish online from this book. <a href="https://github.com/tarquin-the-brave/not-a-v-word-cookbook/issues">Raise an
issue</a> to let me know.</p>
<p>Alternatively if you'd like to contribute to this book, you're more than
welcome to! See the <a href="./contributions.html">contributing guide</a>. I'm keen for
contributions of photos of recipes already in this book too!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="do-this-yourself"><a class="header" href="#do-this-yourself">Do This Yourself</a></h1>
<h2 id="an-online-book"><a class="header" href="#an-online-book">An Online Book</a></h2>
<p>Really this book is &quot;a website&quot;.  So if you're already well versed in creating
websites you don't need this section, crack on doing what you do. For what it's
worth this is the lowest faff way I've encountered to date of creating a
website and the tools I've used have let me spend almost all of the developing
time on content and an extremely minimal amount of time on formatting and such
like. If you're keen to highly customise the formatting then other tools might
be better suited to your desires.  If, like me, you're happy with how this
looks and want to get something up and running fast: here's how you can do
that.</p>
<p>Everything I've used is totally free to use.</p>
<h3 id="command-line"><a class="header" href="#command-line">Command Line</a></h3>
<p><strong>Before you start</strong>: Make sure you are comfortable running a program from
your computer's &quot;command line&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Command line&quot;: a.k.a: &quot;terminal&quot;, &quot;command prompt&quot;, is the little box that
lets you type in commands to a computer.  On Windows, I think it's called
&quot;command&quot;, or &quot;command prompt&quot;.  If you're not familiar with it, you may want
to do a bit of googling for how the terminal works on your computer.  and
practice running programs and moving files, etc.</p>
<p>There are also online tutorials that you can find to help get the basics.</p>
<h3 id="mdbook-and-markdown"><a class="header" href="#mdbook-and-markdown">Mdbook and Markdown</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html"><code>mdbook</code></a> is the main technology I've used here. It's a command line
tool that takes &quot;markdown&quot; documents and generates a book that you can see in
your web browser. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases">Here's the download page</a> to install it for the type
of computer you have. Check out <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html">the documentation</a> and have a play
around with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a lightweight syntax that deals with all the formating
of a document, so you don't have to.  Don't worry, you're not learning a
programming language here.  There's very little to it, I promise.</p>
<p>Once you've installed <code>mdbook</code> and know how to run it, you can write up a few
pages of your book and see it taking shape in your web browser with <code>mdbook watch -o</code>.</p>
<h3 id="github-and-travis"><a class="header" href="#github-and-travis">Github and Travis</a></h3>
<p>Once you've got a few pages, setup a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account.  Github will
store the files you create your book from and, when you're ready will host the
website for you.</p>
<p>Github is pretty good at providing instructions for how to use it.  If you're
unfamiliar with <code>git</code>, it may be worth some searches online for how to do the
specific things you want, like push your work to your Github.</p>
<p>You'll want to create a Github &quot;repository&quot; for your cookbook.  Github will
take you through the steps.</p>
<p><code>mdbook</code> writes the files it generates to a folder called <code>book</code>.  As these are
auto-generated, you won't need Github to look after them for you, and you can
tell <code>git</code> to ignore them by adding a <code>.gitignore</code> file to you repository with
the word <code>book</code> in it.  Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/tarquin-the-brave/not-a-v-word-cookbook/blob/master/.gitignore">copy mine</a>.</p>
<p>When you're ready to publish you can setup your Github repository to
automatically generate your website and publish it.  For this you can use
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>.  There's instructions <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci-using-github">here</a> for how to
&quot;setup Travis with a Github account&quot;.</p>
<p>Travis can be setup to run any kind of build of software, so needs configuring
for this task.  I've done the work here already, so feel free to <a href="https://github.com/tarquin-the-brave/not-a-v-word-cookbook/blob/master/.travis.yml">copy
mine</a>.</p>
<p>Find the option in your Travis account web page to &quot;Add a repository&quot;, then the
next time you &quot;push&quot; your files to your Github repository, a few minutes later,
you'll be able to see your cookbook online at:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">your-github-name.github.io/your-cookbook-name/
</code></pre>
<p>(where <code>your-github-name</code> &amp; <code>your-cookbook-name</code> are replaced with their actual
names)</p>
<p>Hopefully this is enough information to get you started.  The documentation of
these tools is all quite thorough, and their all used by enough people that you
can generally search online &quot;How do I do X with this tool&quot;.  If not there's all
sorts of friendly forums you can ask for help on like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
<p>If you manage OK with <code>mdbook</code> and would like to have more control over
customising your theme, I can recommend <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.  It's a tool for building
websites that's only a little bit more faff than <code>mdbook</code> (but you can do a lot
more with it), and has a huge community of people developing and maintaining
all sorts of themes.  So you don't even have to make your own theme, you can
pick one from the hundreds already available.</p>
<h2 id="an-actual-real-physical-book"><a class="header" href="#an-actual-real-physical-book">An Actual Real Physical Book</a></h2>
<p>Before publishing this book online, I made a physical copy of this book by hand
as a present for a couple of friends who got married.  Here's roughly what I
did.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, a tool for converting documents between formats, to
convert these markdown files into a single <code>odt</code> format file that can be read
by <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> (the free version of Microsoft office).  I don't know if
Microsoft Word can read <code>odt</code> format.  If not Pandoc can always convert to
<code>docx</code> format instead.</p>
<p>Once open in Libre Office I selected all the text, picked a font, size, and
line formatting and set that for the whole of the document.</p>
<p>I then went through and formatted the section headings and made sure each new
recipe started on a new page. The book was ready to print.</p>
<p>I found two great tutorials by this Youtuber called &quot;Sea Lemon&quot; for how to bind
a book by hand online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O4kFTOEh6k">DIY Kettle Stitch Bookbinding Tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av_rU-yOPd4">DIY Hardcover Book</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sea Lemon has loads of tutorials on book binding and crafts.  Check out their
other videos for alternative approaches.</p>
<p>I then had to work out how to print the right pages on the right sides of the
right pieces of paper to create the &quot;signatures&quot; of pages that get sticked
together.  I did this by folding some normal printer paper, arranging them into
signatures, and writing the page numbers on.</p>
<p>I also found that the print we have at home wasn't printing &quot;two pages per
side&quot; centrally on the page, leaving a large blank space to the right. failing
to see how to amend this, I resorted to measuring the discrepancy and trimming
the pages down with a ruler and a scalpel (a guillotine would have been better
for this, I just didn't have one).</p>
<p>All credit to Sea Lemon for helping me to produce the physical book!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="contributions"><a class="header" href="#contributions">Contributions</a></h1>
<p>Thus far this book has only be written by me, but I'm happy to take
contributions.</p>

<h1 id="photography"><a class="header" href="#photography">Photography</a></h1>
<p>You'll notice this book has no photos in it.  That's not a design choice, it's
just that every time I try to take a photo of food it looks like a turd on a
plate.</p>
<p>If you're good at taking photos of food, and have taken some pictures of
recipes you've created from this book, please do get in touch, as I'd love this
book to include photos!</p>
<h1 id="contributing-guidance"><a class="header" href="#contributing-guidance">Contributing Guidance</a></h1>
<p>I'd like any contribution to this book to be in keeping with the mission of the
book and have some continuity of style.</p>
<p>If this style doesn't float your boat, I'd be happy to link to something
you post online written in your own style.  Let me know and I'll add an
&quot;Other Such Works&quot; chapter.</p>
<h2 id="mission"><a class="header" href="#mission">Mission</a></h2>
<p>As <a href="./introduction">the introduction</a> states, this book isn't about
v****ism.  And it's not written to try to preach or convert.  This book is
about enriching and deepening people's experience of food with plants.</p>
<p>There's an industrial pipeline to food productions that favours less diversity.
When I used to eat what the television told me to, I had a pretty limited set
of foods I would eat regularly.  While not entirely leaving the system,
v****s move out of the main firing line for this pipeline and end up coming
across novel ingredients and combinations.  It's these I want to share back
with people so they remember us as the ones who gave them some delicious food,
rather than the ones who made them feel bad about the food they were eating.</p>
<p>As such this book steers clear from including v**** alternatives to meat
dishes.  The focus is on sharing wonderful combinations that happen to only
have plants in which readers can add to their cooking, adding in what they
like.</p>
<h2 id="style"><a class="header" href="#style">Style</a></h2>
<p>Recipe write ups in this book follow a format of: don't list ingredients, don't
be precise about sizes (unless it matters), distill the core of the recipe
before discussing extra non-essential add ons, and provide a TL;DR at the end
for quick reference.</p>
<p>Contributions don't have to follow this exact format, but it would be good if
they achieved the same goals of showing the recipe in its minimal form, being
explicit about what's optional, and having a quick reference.  Basically not
reading like a standard cookbook in the way described in the
<a href="./preface.html">preface</a>.  Specifics can be discussed over a pull request.</p>
