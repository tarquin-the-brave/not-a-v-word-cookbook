# Roasted Cauliflower Pasta

Ever find pasta a bit too heavy. I do.  But also really love pasta.  I do.
Here's a way you can combine it with something lighter and embark on an odyssey
flavour.

What I'm talking about when I say "odyssey of flavour" is unlike when you have
flavours meld, by slow cooking or giving a flash of heat, every mouthful is a
different flavour.  It's got sweet, sour, salty, herby, all hitting you one by
one.

If you're bored of pasta, this will reignite it.

## Here's What To Do

Put the oven on. Get a head of cauliflower and chop up into florets.

Make a dressing from: the juice of a lemon, some olive oil, syrup (maple or
agave), a knob of ginger (chopped or grated), a couple of garlic cloves, a
tablespoon of cumin, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and few cracks of salt.  Give that
a good mix.

Toss the cauliflower florets with small amount of the dressing (2-3
tablespoons) to coat them, spread them out on a baking tray, and pop them in
the oven.  It should take 20 or so minutes for the florets to roast golden, but
keep an eye on them as you don't want to over do it.

Stick some pasta on the boil.  As you've got the cauliflower joining the fray,
put on half as much pasta as you would for a "pasta and sauce" dish.

Chop up some olives and dried apricots. A couple of handfuls of each should do
the trick.  I normally just keep chopping 'til I get bored and then call it.

Once the pasta & cauliflower is ready drain the pasta and save 100ml or so of
the pasta water.  Put the pasta, cauliflower, olives, and apricots in a cold
pot, serving dish, or mixing bowl.  Mix the pasta water you saved off with the
dressing then pour over the rest of the ingredients in the pot.

## The Most Important Thing

The key thing in this dis is to not let the flavours meld. This is why it's a
good idea to mix it all together in a cold container and not in the still warm
pan the pasta was cooked in.

I cooked this recipe once, mixing all the ingredients in the pan, and even gave
it a quick flash on a high heat to help the flavours mix.  It wasn't nice.
Because the main ingredients, the cauliflower florets, the pasta pieces, the
dried apricots, the olives, are all whole and solid things, you'll only have
one or two of them on each forkful. It's a really enjoyable dish when each
forkful takes you to a different place.
