# Fantastic Ingredients & Where To Find Them

Sometimes you don't need a full recipe to make great food, just knowing one
show stopping ingredient that can revolutionise a meal.

Here are some of the ingredients that have blown me away, either on their own
or when they turn up somewhere unexpected.

## Tamerind

I'd never heard of tamerind until I was working through a cookbook in order
of country of origin and found it featured heavily in Afganistani dishes.
It was a big book.  Didn't get beyond "B" to be honest. Turns out when a
country features heavily in the book you get a week of eating the same thing.
One of the countries beginning with "A" was heavy on the stews and casseroles.
I don't like stew.

But anyway tamerind... it's got a wonderfully mellow sweet and savoury flavour.
On on the Afganistani dishes was simply potatoes cooked in tamerind sauce
made by frying some onions then adding stock, spices, & tamerind paste.

Tamerind paste is a great addition to curries or sauces that can add an unexpected
twist.

Idea: tamerind paste added to pie filling?

## Celery - The Flavour Stablizer

You'll notice a common ingredient of vegetable soups is almost always celery.
I'd always considered celery as this "nothing ingredient" that didn't add anything.

But now I've found I'm adding celery to more and more.  It doesn't have much
of a distinct flaour on it's own but added to soup, stew, or even stir fry,
it adds a freshness and helps meld the other flavours into each other, taking
away the sharp edges.

## Silken Tofu

## Smoked Garlic

## Truffle Oil

## Lemongrass

## Frozen Ginger

## Soy Sauce on Pizza

Wat? I shit you not.  This takes pizza into the next dimension.  Don't believe
me?  Try it on a slice.

## Tabasco on Pastry

Tabasco rears its head in all sorts of weird places: in drinks, on oysters, and
here's another one: on savoury pastry.

Once you've dripped tabasco down the back of a sausage roll you'll never look
back.

## Oyster Mushrooms

## Freekeh
