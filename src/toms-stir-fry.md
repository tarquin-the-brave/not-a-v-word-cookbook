# Tom's Stir Fry

This has been one of my longest standing meals I've made myself, and always
been a great one for impressing guests, and making it look like it took way
more effort than it did. The difference this brings to most stir frys this is
more about what's not in it.  It doesn't include some special sauce out of a
packet or painstakingly constructed from scratch, you don't need it.  It
doesn't include noodles, you don't need them.  Noodles can turn what should be
a light and crisp affair into some tummy swelling stodge.

Being one of my oldest recipes it's very much in keeping with my [core cooking
philosophy](./introduction.md#my-cooking-philosophy) of always aiming to strip
meals down to the their core bits, enjoying the simplicity of that, then
throwing things back in when you get bored.

## The Core

Put simply this is some stir fried veg served on some salad leaves, with
beetroot, a smattering of seeds, and only soy sauce in the way of sauce.

Those pre-made packs of stir fry veg are excellent for this.  They give you a
great variety and mean you won't have too much of anything going to waste.
It's worth getting the posh ones like Tesco finest or Sainsbury's taste the
difference as they've got all sorts of fancy veggies in,

Using that pre assembled pack as a base, throw in some pak choi, and any other
veggies that aren't already in the mix that you want.

Really quickly flash fry so the veggies are still al dente.

Put into bowls lined with raw lettuce and spinach.

Add slices of ready-to-eat beetroot and sprinkle over seeds (any seeds, you can
get packs of "salad topping seeds" which are great for this).

Season with soy sauce to taste.

## Flourishes

### Peanut Curry

Taking this to the next level and letting ti become a more filling meal, it can
morph into a glorious peanut curry.

Skipping the "salad bits" of the above (the lettuce, spinach, beetroot) and
leaving the stir fried veg in the pan, add:
- a good few dollops of peanut butter,
- some water, and
- chilli flakes or fresh chillies.

Stir it up and let it simmer for a bit until the water and peanut butter have
mixed into a sauce and reduced to the thickness you want.  I'd personally throw
the seeds in as well.

Serve on rice noodles.
