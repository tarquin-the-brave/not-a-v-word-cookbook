# Portobello Mushrooms & Orange

I'll be honest: this one's a bit odd, and I don't really know how much I like
this dish.  But it's novel, and well worth a try.

It's a flavour combination that nobody asked for, but kind of works, and will
surprise you. You can try this as a starter first time around, then build a
main around it if you like it.

## Here's What To Do

Get 4 portobello mushrooms and a big orange.

Brush/rub some olive oil onto the inside of the mushrooms and place on a baking
tray.

Peel the orange and break into segments trying to remove as much of the white
stuff as possible and cut the pips out if there are any.

Make a mixture of chopped olives, a couple of chopped shallots, some capers,
fresh coriander, a glugs or two of olive oil, and a crack of salt. Put the
orange segments into the mixture.

Put the mixture over the mushrooms.

Grill for 5-10 minutes. Keep an eye on them as you don't want them to burn.

## TL;DR

- Paint inside of portobello mushrooms with olive oil.
- Mix together:
  - Olives, shallots, coriander - all chopped,
  - Capers,
  - Olive oil,
  - Orange segments,
- Put mixture in mushrooms,
- Grill for 5-10 mins.
