# Watermelon Steaks

Say what? This isn't a play on words, I really mean it.  Big, succulent, juicy,
dripping, rare steaks made from watermelon.

Once you've had one of these, you'll never look at watermelon the same again.
You'll see all the people sitting eating slices of raw watermelon and cry
"barbarians!".

For me this filled the hole in my life that steak left. I don't crave steak
anymore.

These bring a world of flavour and are a fantastic party piece that'll blow
your guests' minds.  When the watermelon reduces it adopts a rare meaty
texture.

## The Core

Get a watermelon.  One of those miniature watermelons will do to serve 4
people. You can also use some portion of a large watermelon.  You can buy them
in halves or quarters.

Cut the skin off the watermelon. It's OK to leave some white bits on the
outside as this is a pretty good analogue of the rind.

Massage, with clean hands, some salt and soy sauce into the watermelon.  It's
OK to be fairly liberal with this as it will help the watermelon reduce.

Loosely wrap up the watermelon in foil and place on a baking tray in the oven.

Bake for an hour, then turn the watermelon over in the foil and bake for
another hour.  You'll notice the bottom half is gone wobbly and reduced down
more than the top as it's been sitting in the juice.  That's why you need to
turn it.

While baking prepare the marinade: A dollop of tahini; a good amount of soy
sauce; a squeeze of sriracha; a few glugs of olive oil; a splash of some form
of vinegar; some chilli flakes; and a clove of garlic, a knob of ginger, and
some spring onions, all chopped finely.

After baking the watermelon should have a wobbly, raw meat, texture and feel to
it.  If it is still a bit stiff, bake it some more.

Transfer the watermelon to a bowl or container lined in greaseproof paper.
Mark where you want to cut your steaks by making incisions roughly 1/3 the way
down as if you were slicing your steak.  With a spoon drip the marinade down
the groves, then once they're full: pour the rest of the marinade over the
watermelon and wrap up in the greaseproof paper.  Place the watermelon in the
fridge to marinade.

I'd say marinade it for at least 2 hours in the fridge. Longer is better.

When you're ready to eat the steaks: finish the incisions to cut the watermelon
into steaks.  Flash fry for just a minute or so on each side on a high high
heat. While frying you can drizzle on some of the excess marinade.

You can serve these with whatever you normally eat steak with. Personally I
think these work best served with a fresh crisp salad with lots of crunchy
things in like sugar snap peas, shredded carrot, and the like.

## Timings

You'll notice the total elapsed time for this dish is quite long, even though
the actually preparation time is not so much.  I tend to prepare this over a
day: baking the watermelon in the morning, mixing the marinade at lunch,
marinading over the afternoon, and flash frying and eating for dinner.

## Flourishes

### Save off the Baking Juice

If the juice that comes off the watermelon while baking chars at all, and has
little black bits floating in it, then don't worry about it and throw it away.
But if covering the watermelon has done its job and the juice is clear, save it
off in a jar.

It's a mix of the salt, soy sauce, and the sugars that came out of the
watermelon as it has reduced. It's great as a sweet and salty dressing for a
salad or use elsewhere in cooking.

### Serve the Leftover Marinade as a Sauce

This depends a bit on how much you like spice.  The marinade on its own is very
spicy.  If you're up for it, you can drizzle the leftover marinade over the
steaks as a sauce.

If not you can save it to use elsewhere in cooking or throw it away.

## A Sneaky Shortcut

Say one day we're not locked in our houses working from home all day, and you
want to prepare this meal in the span of an evening.

You can cut the baking time down to ~30-40 mins by slicing the raw watermelon
into steaks, opting for thinner slices, and not covering them in the oven.
Watch you don't burn them!

With smaller slices you can cut down the marinading time too as there will be a
greater surface area to volume ratio. As with any marinading, the longer the
better, but patience is a virtue and we're not always virtuous.  Given say ~20
mins to marinade, you can get the total elapsed cooking time down to ~1 hour.

## TL;DR

- Cut off skin of watermelon,
- Rub in salt and soy sauce,
- Bake in tin foil for several hours,
- Score groves where you want the steaks to go,
- Marinade in fridge in:
  + Tahini,
  + Soy sauce,
  + Sriracha,
  + Chilli flakes,
  + Garlic,
  + Ginger,
  + Spring onion,
  + Some form of vinegar,
  + Olive oil,
- Flash fry,
- Serve with a crisp salad, or whatever.
