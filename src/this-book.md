# This Book

I don't like cookbooks.  I tolerate them, but I always find myself scrawling
some rough notes and working from them.  One of the things they seem to never
be able to convey is what the core of the recipe is that makes it what it is.
Following a recipe in a cookbook, it's never clear to me what the stakes are
for deviating from the precise ingredients and process.  If I realise I forgot
an ingredient half way through cooking: is the meal ruined? Do I bail out and
start again?  Do I try to compensate? Or do I do nothing?  Was the ingredient
just a arbitrary flourish that made no difference to the overall meal
whatsoever, but included to make you spend hours searching a supermarket for
cilantro, only to find out it's fucking coriander... and not even important to
the dish. I then find that I stop following cookbooks' instructions, because I
grow tired of them and start guessing proportions.  This is normally fine,
until it comes to things like soy sauce, or ginger, when too much can destroy a
meal.

So in this book I'll aim to call out what the core of the recipe is, then add
suggestions of flourishes, while staying away from being too precise about
process or proportions, unless it really matters.  There'll be some recipes
that I haven't really dissected into "a core" and "flourishes".  For these I'll
just say "here's what you do". I'll finish each recipe with a TL;DR to serve as
a quick reference while cooking.
