# Celery & Peanut Butter

I did say not all of these would be full recipes...

Literally get a stick of celery, and put a knob of peanut butter on it.

Great for a mid-night or mid-afternoon snack to stave off hunger, or as nibbles
to serve with drinks.

Make sure the peanut butter is palm oil free!

## TL;DR

- Put peanut butter on celery,
- Eat.
