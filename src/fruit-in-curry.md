# Fruit In Curries

This was going to be a recipe in itself, but I haven't reliably got it to come
out good yet.  I don't really know what "the core" of it is. The last two times
I made it, it came out horrible.  It was vaguely a recipe where you fry up
chunks of apple, then throw in peanuts, raisins, curry powder and water then
let simmer for a bit and serve on coconut rice.  The last time I made it, it
came out _way_ to sweet.  It tasted like a pudding.  And I don't like puddings
that much. I'd normally rather have second main.  I think the trick is going to
be picking an apple that's especially tart and not over cooking it.  I'll give
it another go at some point.

Although, the times that dish did work: the result was incredible.  And so
novel.  A fruit curry!  Who'd have thought!?

I'd say my takeaway from the times it has worked has been:

> Don't be afraid to toss whatever fruit you've got that needs
  eating in whatever you're cooking, curries especially.

Then I suppose the takeaway from when it has gone wrong is:

> Don't make it the centre of the dish and expect it to not come
  out sweet.

We tend to think of fruit as being reserved for sweet dishes, but actually you
see them cropping up all over the place (the [Mushroom & Orange
Tartare](./mushroom-orange.md) in this book, for example) in savoury dishes
too.

## TL;DR

- Put more fruit in more curries.
