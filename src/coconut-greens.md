# Coconut Greens

As kids we're told to eat our greens. They get boiled to death and slopped on
your plate.  It's somewhere between a chore and torture.  Later in life some
fitness freak will tell you you have to steam all your greens.  For the right
greens in the right dish, this can add a crisp freshness to offset something
else that's quite intense in terms of saltiness, oiliness, or stodgy. But
steaming every vegetable can also leave you with tasteless and soulless food.

Sometimes you want your greens to just taste EPIC on their own accord.  Enter
coconut.

## The Core

The core of this is to toss your greens in coconut oil and desiccated coconut
(coconut dust), then cook as you like.

Placing on a oven tray lined with tin foil and putting under the grill is how
I'd cooked them.  You can also bake or fry them.  However you cook them, I'd
advise not over doing it and keeping the greens with a bit of bite to them.

## Which Greens?

I'd say any greens that hold their shape when cooked and have a nice al dente
bite.  So not leafy greens, or legumes.  Some great examples of greens I've
cooked like this are:

- Tenderstem Broccoli (top recommendation),
- Okra, and
- Asparagus.

## Flourishes?

I could go into flourishes.  But really you should add whatever you like.  Also
you'd only be a few flourishes and a bit of chilli away from a simple Thai
curry.

## TL;DR

- Toss your greens in coconut oil and coconut dust,
- Grill - keep al dente.
