# Not A V\*\*\*\* Cookbook

Let me start by saying that I will not be using “the V word” anywhere in this
book, and it is not a “V word cookbook” but a collection of some cooking
wisdoms that I’ve gathered over the past few year as part of being “one of
those”, having to unlearn and relearn a food culture, picking up some novel
combinations on the way.  This book will look to share some of those novel
combinations to incorporate into your cooking either as sides, starters, or
full mains with the protein of your choice substituted in.
