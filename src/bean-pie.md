# Random Bean Pie

A great cupboard clearer.

We've all done it.  While aimlessly wondering around the super market passed
the tinned bean isle, seen some exotic sounding bean name that you've never
heard of and thought, yeah go on.  This tin of beans then sits at the back of
your kitchen cupboard for years taking up space.  Eventually, having never seen
a recipe where you can use them, you give up and crack the tin, drain them, and
plop them on a salad, or serve with you main meal, only to find they're pretty
bland on their own.

We know the usual suspect for this: fava beans, black eye beans, boroletti
beans, butter beans, aduki beans, haricot beans, "mixed" beans, flageolet beans
(no idea how to pronounce that one), pinto beans, lupin beans, the list goes
on. I've just been perusing an organic shop website to find those names, I'd
not be able to name any of them off the top of my head.  It's a long list.
It's not like "person, woman, man, camera, TV".

## Here's What To Do

Get a pie dish.

Put on the boil: enough potato, sweet potato, and any other root vegetables
that you have lying around (carrots make a pretty tasty addition), to provide
an inch thick mashed top in your dish.  If in doubt, cook more, you can always
use the excess elsewhere.  I always leave the skins on.  There's so much
texture and flavour that gets thrown away when you peel veg.

Meanwhile, stick the oven on and prepare the pie dish. This is where you take
all those tins of odd beans, drain them, rinse them, and chuck them in the pie
dish.

Then throw in a tin of tomatoes, a couple of chopped garlic cloves, and some
mix of other such "back of the cupboard" sauces you've got lying around: Lea &
Perrins, a squeeze of HP, maybe a dollop of mustard, go nuts.  Throw in some
herbs to preference.  A standard blend like "Herb de Provence", or "Italian
Herb Mix", would be a good fit for this dish.  I can never get that excited
about black pepper, it seems to either go unnoticed, or be too much and destroy
a dish. But if you like adding pepper, you can crack some of that in too.

Once Potato and Co. have boiled enough to be mashable: take them out and mash
them.  I like my mash quite rough and chunky, and for this dish it provides
quite a nice texture to the pie top.  I quite firmly believe that it is
essential for all mash to have copious amount of mustard mixed into it. Do with
that what you will.

Make sure the pie contents is nicely mixed together then top the pie with about
a centimetre (or two) of your mash.  I think it's good to have a thin top.  I
like pies to be mostly filling. You only need enough to cover the filling. You
can take the opportunity to decorate you pie by taking a fork and drawing a
pretty pattern, writing a special message, or just drawing a cock.

Slowly bake the pie on a lower heat for ~45 minutes or so. Everything is
already cooked, you're just slow cooking it to let the flavours meld.

## TL;DR

- Boil some potato and friends,
- Throw every bean tin you have (drained) into a pie dish,
- Add in:
  + Tinned tomato,
  + A couple of garlic cloves,
  + Sauces such as: Lea & Perrins, HP,
  + Generic herbs,
- Mash potato and friends roughly (adding mustard),
- Top pie with ~1cm of the mash,
- Slow cook in oven for ~45 mins.
