# Pitta Pizzas

The easiest, quickest crowd pleaser around.  Seven minutes to perfection.
Starter, side, nibbles, or quick lunchtime snack.  Minimal effort, let the
ingredients do the talking and you can take all the credit.

For me this dish is a great opportunity to exercise simplicity, opting for
fewer ingredients to let each pitta be focussed on just a couple of flavours.
You can also squeeze on every topping under the sun and do all the flourishes
in one go.  Up to you.

## The Core

Get some pitta breads, smear on some tomato puree, add any ingredients you
want, drizzle over some olive oil, bake in the oven for 5 minutes.

For any toppings you do put on: it's best to make sure they're thin slices, so
they cook a bit in the short time.

The only other note I'd make is that the tomato puree will make or break this
dish.  Splash out the extra 50p and get the posh one.

## Toppings

There's some obvious toppings that you'd expect: olives, mushrooms, artichoke
hearts, onion.

There's also some you might not expect...

Potato! Yes potato on pizza is a Swedish thing apparently, and with these pitta
pizzas, thin slices of new potatoes works incredibly.

Caramelized onion is another winner.  It does mean you have to make some
caramelized onions though, which elevates the faff to results ratio somewhat.

So really you can put whatever toppings on you like, it's your pitta.  The only
thing I'd say is "less is more" when it comes to toppings.  What I've done in
the past is when preparing a platter of 4 or so pitta pizzas and chopping them
up to share or have as nibbles, I've put one or two toppings on each. That cuts
out a lot of the noise and lets you appreciate the beautiful simplicity of the
individual flavours.

## Flourishes

The "flourishes" of this dish come in what you do with the sauce.

I've said to smear tomato puree on the pitta base.  Try mixing in some chilli
puree, garlic puree, BBQ sauce, or pesto (but not all at once).  Little
separate dollops of pesto also works well.

You can also try sprinkling herbs across before adding the toppings. "generic
Italian herb mix" is a good start, but I'd recommend finding one herb that you
really want the flavour of in the pizza and sticking to that.

## TL;DR

- Pitta bread,
- Smear on some tomato puree,
- Add toppings, less is more,
- Drizzle over olive oil,
- In oven for 5 mins.
