# Bang Bang Bang Bang Cauliflower

You may have had something like this in a restaurant or pub as a starter or
side.  In fact the number of "Bang"s above is not just a reflection of how
delicious this is but also to not name this exactly as it is named in a popular
Japanese restaurant.

In my opinion, this dish is a shining example of the sort of cooking I like
best: "make boring veg taste good", while doing something incredibly simple. In
fact: the core concept to this dish is so simple, it's actually a bit hard to
express it in the "Core, then Flourishes" format of this book.  "The Core" will
go a bit beyond the truly minimal core of this recipe. But here goes...

# The Core

Essentially what we're doing here is cooking up some cauliflower with some
chillies and spices in sesame oil. We can also include one or two other
"complimentary" veggies (e.g: celery, peppers, what ever you have lying around
in the fridge).

Chop the cauliflower into florets of a size that you'd be comfortable forking
into your mouth.  The size of your mouth might be a factor here.  Chop any
complimentary veggies into much smaller pieces than your cauliflower florets.
You're going to be going for the florets with your fork and you want some of
the other bits of veg to come with it.

Throws these into a mixing bowl, pour in some sesame oil, sprinkle in some
sesame seeds, and shake in some Chinese five spice.

You can either chop up some fresh chillies and throw them in or shake over some
chilli seeds (or even just add in chilli sauce at the end if you don't have
either of those).  The more chilli the better I'd say.  It's meant to be a
spicy dish.  But of course, add chilli to taste.

Get your hands in and toss that mixture all around so the oil, spices, and
chilli are evenly distributed.

Throw all this into a pan or wok on a high heat and cook 'til the cauliflower
is browning slightly.

It's now ready to eat.  You can serve up as it is with a splash of soy sauce or
add a sauce into the pan ([see below][sauce]).

# Flourishes

## How I Did It Last Time

The last time I did this I went with mushrooms and celery as the "complimentary
veg", used fresh chillies for spice, and added in cherry tomatoes and peanut
butter at the end to make a sauce.

I added finely chopped celery to the mixing bowl with the cauliflower florets
to toss with the celery with the sesame oil, sesame seeds, freshly chopped
chillies, and Chinese five spice. I tossed the mushrooms in olive oil in a
separate bowl before adding all of this to the pan for frying.

Once the cauliflower was cooked I added some chopped cherry tomatoes, a couple
of spoonfuls of peanut butter, a splash of soy sauce, and poured over a decent
amount of water from the kettle.

I mixed it all together and put a lid on the pan to let it all stew for a
little bit.  I then took the lid off the pan and let the excess water boil off
'til the sauce had reduced to the thickness I wanted.

I served it on rice.

## The Sauce

The simplest possible version of a sauce for this could be to add in some soy
sauce and water to the pan and let to water boil off.  Perhaps putting in a bit
of cornflour to thicken it up a bit.

For a more savoury flavour you could put in some dollops of peanut butter or
tahini, as I did above.

You could also go for more of a sticky glaze.  For this you need something
sugary like: sugar, honey, maple or agave syrup.  Add this in with a reasonable
amount of water so everything gets spread around evenly.  Boil off the water
until a sugary coating covers all the bits of veg.

## Other Possibilities

The rest of the possibility space around this dish is in what you include in
the "complimentary veg".  Last time I made this I held an onion in my hand for
a good few seconds before deciding against it.  Partly because the celery was
already performing the supporting role, but also because I didn't want yet
anther evening's cooking to start with chopping an onion.

I suppose you can take a "whatever you've got in the fridge" approach to this.
That's what I did with the cherry tomatoes and it was a lovely addition
flavour.

## TL;DR

- Chop cauliflower into \[gob-sized\] florets.
- Chop any complimentary veg into much smaller pieces.
- Toss them in a mixing bowl with:
  + sesame oil,
  + chilli (fresh or seeds),
  + Chinese five spice,
  + and sesame seeds.
- Fry on a high heat 'til the cauliflower is cooked (browning a little).
- Add:
  + a little soy sauce,
  + a dollop of peanut butter (or alternative[^1]),
  + a splash of water,
- Simmer to reduce to the thickness you want.
