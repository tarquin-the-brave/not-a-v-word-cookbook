# Kale in Peanut Sauce

Kale is pretty boring, you've got to give it some flavour.  What better to
flavour it with than a creamy peanut sauce.

Serve as an epic side, or extend with the flourishes until you have a full
meal.

## The Core

Prepare a peanut sauce in a pyrex jar by mixing some dollops of peanut butter
with some cream (soy, oat, or coconut) and enough hot water for it to mix
together smoothly.

Begin to stir fry some thin slices of parsnip (or any other root vegetable like
potato or sweet potato) and celery in wok.

Once they're fried a little pile the kale over the top and pour a little bit of
water over everything so the kale steams over the other vegetables. You can
also drizzle over some soy sauce.

Once the kale has shrunk up and taken up a dark green colour throughout, pour
over the peanut sauce and stir everything together and reduce until the sauce
is sufficiently thick.

## Flourishes

### Chilli

Peanut and spice works rather nice. Try adding in some chilli flakes or fresh
chilli.

### More Veg

I've suggested quickly stir frying thin slices of parsnip and celery to act as
a simple base for the flavour before adding the kale and sauce. You can keep
going with the veg at this stage and add all the veg you might add to a stir
fry: sugar snap peas, cabbage, beansprouts, mushrooms, etc.

As with everything, I'd say keep it simple, then add things after you've tried
the minimal version of the dish.

### A Curry

Keep adding veg to the initial sir fry stage, and soon this dish will become a
meal in itself.

Serve over rice as a curry.

## TL;DR

- stir fry parsnip and celery
- pile kale on top
- pour over water to steam kale
- sprinkle soy sauce
- pour over peanut sauce:
  + peanut butter
  + soy cream (or other)
  + hot water
