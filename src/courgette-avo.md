# Courgetti-Mole

Another super simple, can't get this wrong, 5 minute, fresh dish that can be a
luscious lunch, or a base for your protein that blows boring old spaghetti or
noodles out of the water.

## The Core

The core to this meal is the sauce that you coat the courgetti with. Smash up
some avocado in a bowl with some dollops of pesto and finely chopped garlic
cloves.

How many cloves depend on how much you like garlic.  I'd personally go for a
clove per person, but you many want to turn that down to half a clove per
person on the first attempt.

Spiralize a courgette or two into courgetti.  Flash fry in pan on hight heat
for no more than a couple of minutes, you don't want the courgetti to go soggy!

Mix the courgetti in with the mixture and crack over some pepper to serve.

## Flourishes

### Change Out the Courgetti

If you want to turn this fresh and uplifting ensemble into a hearty hangover
cure, or a carbo-loading king, swap out the courgetti for some fat udon
noodles.

### Garnishes

Try throwing in some seeds and fresh herbs.  Or a teaspoon of spirulina if
you're feeling brave.

## Have it Raw

I've said flash fry the courgetti.  You can not cook the courgetti at all and
enjoy an even crisper cold variation.

## TL;DR

- Smash up some avo in a bowl with pesto and garlic,
- Spiralize some courgetti and flash fry,
- Mix in sauce,
- Serve.
