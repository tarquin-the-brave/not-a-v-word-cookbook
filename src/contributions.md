# Photography

You'll notice this book has no photos in it.  That's not a design choice, it's
just that every time I try to take a photo of food it looks like a turd on a
plate.

If you're good at taking photos of food, and have taken some pictures of
recipes you've created from this book, please do get in touch, as I'd love this
book to include photos!

# Contributing Guidance

I'd like any contribution to this book to be in keeping with the mission of the
book and have some continuity of style.

If this style doesn't float your boat, I'd be happy to link to something
you post online written in your own style.  Let me know and I'll add an
"Other Such Works" chapter.

## Mission

As [the introduction](./introduction) states, this book isn't about
v\*\*\*\*ism.  And it's not written to try to preach or convert.  This book is
about enriching and deepening people's experience of food with plants.

There's an industrial pipeline to food productions that favours less diversity.
When I used to eat what the television told me to, I had a pretty limited set
of foods I would eat regularly.  While not entirely leaving the system,
v\*\*\*\*s move out of the main firing line for this pipeline and end up coming
across novel ingredients and combinations.  It's these I want to share back
with people so they remember us as the ones who gave them some delicious food,
rather than the ones who made them feel bad about the food they were eating.

As such this book steers clear from including v\*\*\*\* alternatives to meat
dishes.  The focus is on sharing wonderful combinations that happen to only
have plants in which readers can add to their cooking, adding in what they
like.

## Style

Recipe write ups in this book follow a format of: don't list ingredients, don't
be precise about sizes (unless it matters), distill the core of the recipe
before discussing extra non-essential add ons, and provide a TL;DR at the end
for quick reference.

Contributions don't have to follow this exact format, but it would be good if
they achieved the same goals of showing the recipe in its minimal form, being
explicit about what's optional, and having a quick reference.  Basically not
reading like a standard cookbook in the way described in the
[preface](./preface.md).  Specifics can be discussed over a pull request.
