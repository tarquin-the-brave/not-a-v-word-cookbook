# Your Recipes

I'm interested to read about any plant-based recipes you have!

If you want to recreate a book like this, I've written [a
guide](./do-this-yourself.md) on how to do that.

I'm happy to link to anything you publish online from this book. [Raise an
issue][rai] to let me know.

Alternatively if you'd like to contribute to this book, you're more than
welcome to! See the [contributing guide](./contributions.md). I'm keen for
contributions of photos of recipes already in this book too!
