# Mung Bean & Lentil Sandwich Filler

Get this right and it'll come out just like tuna mayonnaise! Or turn down the
oil a bit and get something crisper tasting.  Either way it's hearty!

## TL;DR

- Overcook some lentils and mung beans,
- Throw in: olive oil, a squoze lemon, capers, celery, cherry tomatoes,
- Heat on a quick high heat stirring for ~30 secs to set the flavours off
  melding,
- Blend the mixture,
- Serve on toast or refrigerate for tomorrow's sandwiches with some slices of
  cucumber.

Alternatively: don't overcook the lentils and mung beans, don't blend the
mixture.  But that's not as nice.
