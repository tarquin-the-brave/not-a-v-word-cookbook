# Mung Bean & Lentil Sandwich Filler

This one I discovered by total accident!

One day I was intending on making a [lentil salad](#eat-as-a-salad-instead).  I
found some "mung beans" in the cupboard next to the lentils.  I had no idea
what they were but thought they were lentil-like so threw them in too.  I set a
pot of lentils and mung beans on the boil, then got distracted.  I was adding
little dampening rings to my mechanical keyboard as it was pretty klackerty.
The involved pulling off every key cap and pushing a silicone ring into the
inside of it. Then I got chatting to a mate on the phone.  Then about 40
minutes later, I suddenly remembered. "Ah! My lentils!" I exclaimed and rushed
into the kitchen to find the lentils had all swollen and started to
disintegrate, and the much beans had basically exploded.

It looked like the meal was a bit ruined but I noticed the exploded mung beans
had a dry fibre-y texture, almost a bit like tinned tuna... This gave me an
idea!  I added the rest of the salad ingredients, some olive oil, capers (for a
fishy flavour), and a squeeze of lemon, then blended the mixture and spread it
on toast.

This now stands as my go-to hearty sandwich filler.

## The Core

The key to this is to overcook the lentils and mung beans so they're soft and
add enough olive oil so the mixture doesn't taste too dry.

While the lentils are cooking, chop up some celery and cherry tomatoes (or any
tomatoes you want really), and have some capers ready (you normally have to
fish them out of a jar with a fork, so good to do ahead of time).

Once you've overcooked the lentils and mung beans, 30-40 minutes on the boil
should do the trick, drain and put back in the pan.

Throw in the celery, tomatoes, and capers.  Pour in a good couple of glugs of
olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Mix the ingredients together and heat on a high heat for a minute or less to
give it a shock of heat to get the flavours mixing.

Blend the mixture.

Serve hot on toast or put it in the fridge for tomorrow's sandwiches. Slices
of cucumber in the sandwich perfectly complement this filling.

The only proportion advice I'd give, is don't over do it on the lemon.  I did
that once and it was a bit too tangy.

_Mung beans are also known as adzuki/azuki/aduki beans the difference being
that adzuki beans are "red mung beans", it would appear._

## Flourishes

### Change of Base

While the base of this is mung bean and lentils, you can try basing this on
more or other legumes such as chickpeas, soybeans, etc.

When I tried chickpeas, the texture of the mixture went a bit potato-y, and I
didn't like it as much.

### Spices

I've not experimented too much with putting much spices in this.  When I've had
fresh parsley to hand, that's gone in.

I'd guess the green herby herbs would do well in this.  I'm unsure what the
effect of adding chilli to it would be.  Try it.

## Eat as a Salad Instead

You can, of course, not overcook the lentils and mung beans, use less olive
oil, not blend the mixture and enjoy as a lentil salad or a bed to serve your
protein on.

## TL;DR

- Overcook some lentils and mung beans,
- Throw in: olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, capers, celery, cherry tomatoes,
- Heat on a quick high heat stirring for ~30 secs to set the flavours off
  melding,
- Blend the mixture,
- Serve on toast or refrigerate for tomorrow's sandwiches with some slices of
  cucumber.
