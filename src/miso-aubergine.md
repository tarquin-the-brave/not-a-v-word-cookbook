# Miso Aubergine

_Or "eggplant" if you're that way inclined._

A great surprise addition to a BBQ. We suffer somewhat from having a set idea
what BBQ food is, when really you can do anything.  You can pre-prepare this
one, wrap it in foil, and sneak it onto the BBQ while no-one's watching.  Once
cooked, you can open up the tin foil give everyone a fork and gather round.
This will have more flavour than most of what's on the rest of the BBQ
combined.

## The Core

Aubergine & miso paste.

Chop you aubergines in half long ways. Score the flesh on the inside of the
aubergine with the knife to draw a grid pattern.  I like to make grid squares
about 2cm x 2cm and cut right down to the inside of the skin so you can scoop
out cubes one by one when eating. You need a bit of a stead hand to not cut
through the skin too.

Using a combination of a spoon and clean fingers: smear miso paste over the
aubergine, getting as much of it as you can down the cracks in your grid
pattern.

Wrap up each aubergine half in foil and cook on the BBQ for 20-30 mins. It's
hard to say exactly as BBQs vary from those mini disposable ones to gas giants.
You want to cook them till the aubergine flesh has lost its firmness, and then
a bit longer to get the miso flavour to fully mix in.

## Flourishes

### Maple Syrup

Once you've smeared on the miso paste, spread some maple syrup over the top.
This will add another flavour dimension to the aubergine and make the flesh go
all sticky.

### Smaller Squares or Baby Aubergines

If you're looking to get more of a sauce to go into more of a food thing, you
will want to increase the surface area to volume ratio.  You do that by making
things smaller.  It's why you can drop a squirrel out of a plane.

With this dish, with the recommended 2cm x 2cm squares, you get a bit of a
gradient where the centre of the cubes haven't got as much of the miso taste in
them.  If you want the miso to permeate through more of the aubergine you can
cut smaller squares, or use baby aubergines to get the size reduction in a 3rd
dimension.

## Serve as a Main Instead

Instead of the BBQ, you can cook these in the oven.  A great meal is these
served on a lentil salad or on greens.  Steamed peas and samphire perhaps.

## TL;DR

- Slice aubergine long ways,
- Score a 2cm x 2cm grid on the inside,
- Rub in miso paste (getting ti down all the cracks),
- Wrap each aubergine half in foil,
- Put on BBQ for 20-30 mins.
