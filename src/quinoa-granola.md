# Quinoa In Granola

Wat? I agree. It sounds mental. But when the granola is toasting in the oven
the quinoa pops and gives the granola a real light texture. Normally I find
granola out of a packet a bit heavy going, I'm not a great morning eater, and
too sugary!

Granola out of a packet never has that same toasted flavour, and I've not yet
seen one where they've put quinoa in it!

## The Core

The core of this granola is: oats, quinoa, Brazil nuts, and some syrup to bind
it all together (maple syrup is good).

The Brazil nuts are a must! When toasted they adopt this incredible flavour,
and have a really great bite!

Mix the ingredients in a bowl, lay out on a baking tray, and roast in the oven
for about 10 minutes.

## Flourishes

While making a granola with just the core ingredients above will be delicious,
I'd take the opportunity to throw in every nut, and seed, you've got in your
cupboard.  Here's a few I've mixed in in the past:

- Cashew nuts,
- Pistachio nuts,
- Pine nuts,
- Sunflower seeds,
- Chia seeds - these also pop like the quinoa,
- Pumpkin seeds,
- Agave syrup.

Any nut you add, add them raw.

After toasting you can throw in some desiccated coconut (coconut dust).  It's
nice! But I've stopped adding this as it does dominate the flavour a bit, and
there's enough coconut in my life as it stands.

Adding dried fruit? I'm not personally a fan of this.  I don't like the texture
going from crunchy to squidgy and back to crunchy as I'm eating.  I prefer to
serve the granola with fresh fruit or a smoothie. But if that's you're thing,
go for it!

## TL;DR

- Mix oats, quinoa, and Brazil nuts in a bowl,
- Mix in whatever the hell else you want,
- Throw in some maple syrup - the more you put in the more clumpy the granola
  will be,
- Toast in the oven for 10 mins,
- Throw in any extras and store.
